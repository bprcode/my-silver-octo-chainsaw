Practice managed repository
or, "A Tail of Two Birds"

## Purpose

This is a simple readme file in a repository which is being used to practice pull requests.

Many remarkable feathered animals exist, but penguins are the coolest.

### Note

Warning: Do not attempt to feed candy to birds of any kind.

Penguins would look cool in little bowties.
